# Christos Presentation #

I think his presentation was very informative and gave a different perspective about open source. 
I thought it was interesting how open source for him was something that helped him better himself as a person.
I say that in the sense that it not only helped him with English skills but also helped him have better people skills.
He did something that he felt passionate about and it in turn helped him be a better version of himself. When he spoke
about the mozilla mission I definitely saw it with a different lense than before. When he explained it, what I got is that what
they do they do for the people so that we can have better tools and access while not caring to make a profit from it like
others might. Thus, I most definitely admire it more now.

# Habitica license #

From what I gathered it has 2 linceses. The GNU and creative commons license. They repeated the commons one twice for different 
parts. Overall, I would say their policies in general dictate that credit be given when they are due, that people are open to use
it and not use it for any profit.


# Installation #

 I decided to install the environment for Habitica. For the most part, everything went smoothly. There were some parts where I 
 stumbled a bit but I was able to figure it out. Also, some of the instructions they have are a little outdated. Nevertheless, 
 the instructions are good. They give good documentation for installing their project.
