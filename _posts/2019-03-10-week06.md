#Thought on Projects with Humanitarian Goals #

I think tis kind of projects are the ones that show some of people who really do and contribute because of something they feel
passionate about it. With prestige, I don't know if I would say it gives more or less because regardless people who help in
open sources projects usually do it as a hobby or because they feel strongly about it. I think, if anything, involvement might 
be a bit easier because usually causes don't have enought people/staff who are willing to dedicate themselves to something they
might not gain anything from as in money or recognititon. Hence, they enocurage people to join and help out. I feel like it is
something I would be interested in doing or at least trying once.
