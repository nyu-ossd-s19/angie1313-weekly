# Kevin Fleming

I think that the most interesting and surprising thng he spoke about is how open source is becoming more and more involved in all aspects of his
workplace Bloomberg. I had heard before that open source is becoming more well known and people are looking at it for 
their own purposes. Nonetheless, when he was saying the point really cam across to me. The fact that they are trying to replace
what they have with the tools that open source have for it just comes to show important it is and its true value. Thus, I guess
the point would be how infuential and useful open source is becoming to different spaces.

# Project

So far for the project I have submitted a PR which got accepted. It was a document that ws completely blank before. When I
did the pr i learned a but about how it's important to have your email connected to your git when submitting pr's because I had
that issue. Also the community was ver nice in helping me make a change to the document I had made to fit their requirements and\
for it to be merged.
