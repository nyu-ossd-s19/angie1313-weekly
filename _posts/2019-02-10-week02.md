 ## What are my contributions to our project?

In my groups' project I have added the html for the stopwatch that will track the time spent on page. I am working on the code to actually make it work. I had just recently added it because I am not the best with github so I had to get a better understanding of it. 

## What is the state of our extension?

Other members have added timers that will go off at 5 and 20 minutes to let the user know how much time has passed. The problem we face is putting it to work together or even the specifics of how it will work exactly. It doesn't seem like we will have it done by tomorrow but we will be close.

## What is Ssmething new I learned from GIT?

Something I learned about GitHub is what the settings option has to offer like changing the name of the repository and deleting one. In addition, I understand better the workings of upstreaming, how to fork and making changes to files.
