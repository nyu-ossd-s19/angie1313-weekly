# How has the collaborative part of the project been so far? ##

*1. My experience creating the extension * 

I had been having some issues with making the stopwatch as an addition to our extension. It would not start counting down when a page was opened. After struggling with it for a couple of days, I found out it was a small syntax error that was causing such an issue. Once I fixed it, it worked properly. Even though as I was thinking about it, I might need to make some stylistic modifications. 

*2. How has it been working with others? Did we work remotely? *
Working as a work has been good so far. When I got stuck on the permissions part of the manifest, I asked my members for help aand they were very nice and helpful. For our project, we have been able to work remotely. However, I am sure if we needed to meet up, it would not be a problem. 

*3. How are the decisions about the project made? How do we communicate? *
Working together has been good and very informative for me. If we have any questions or issues we ask everyone in a group chat we have to make sure we are all in accordance. Thus, we have had fruitful conversations.
