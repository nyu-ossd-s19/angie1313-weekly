# Possbile Project #

In my search for a project I may be interested in, I found one that uses real life situations and turns it into a game. 
To some it might seem harsh or unappealing. I, on the other hand, thought it to be intesting. It may help make some life
decisions easier or more bearable. Thus, I decided to the evaluation on it. From what I gathered it seems like a good first
project with only the flaw that documentation is not its stronghold. Nonetheless, interesting and perhaps worth it. The evaluation is 
below.
