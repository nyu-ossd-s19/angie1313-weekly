# Progress Toward the Project #

So far what I have done is download the environment for the our project Home Assistant and made an accoun to explore what it 
had. Right now we are trying to look at the information they have to tell us about it, so we can internalize it and make a 
helpful contribution to the project. We will be looking at what i smething we could possibly contribut in.

# Wikipedia #

I think that anyone can contribute to wikipedia and I think that those who do it are not just people who are specilaized in
a certain area of knowlegde but also regular people who just happen to know information about a certain topic. Honestly, I
think it will be unlikely for me to be regular contributor but you never know. When I do contribute I will of course look at 
the page and try using it to seeif there is any errors I may be able to fix like a spelling error or broken link. If not, go
to pages about things I know and may be able to contribute to.
